# Artifacts for username.repo.github.io

This public repository hosts built artifacts (compiled bundles, static site output, or ZIP archives) produced by the private source repository 8h28xf8szk-bit/username.repo.github.io. The public artifacts repo is intended so other projects or CI can download ready-to-use outputs without exposing the private source code.

## Purpose

- Store only build outputs (ZIPs, compiled binaries, static site files). Do NOT store source code.
- Provide a simple, unauthenticated download location for consumers.
- Make it easy to revoke publishing access by removing the deploy key.

## Repository structure

- artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/ : dated folders that contain artifact files named like artifact-<timestamp>.zip
- releases/ : optional — GitHub Releases may be used for signed release artifacts

## How publishing works (recommended setup)

1. In the artifacts repo (this repo), add a deploy key (public SSH key) with write access:
   - Repository -> Settings -> Deploy keys -> Add deploy key -> check "Allow write access"
2. In the private source repo (8h28xf8szk-bit/username.repo.github.io), add the corresponding private SSH key as a repository secret (name: TARGET_REPO_SSH_KEY).
3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow to the private repo that builds the project, packages the output (artifact-<timestamp>.zip), then uses the deploy key SSH to push the artifact into this repo under artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/.

## Security notes

- Rotate or remove the deploy key immediately if it is compromised. Removing the key from this repo revokes write access.
- Never copy or publish your private source files into this repo.
- If you prefer authenticated downloads or restricted access, consider publishing to a package registry or using presigned URLs.

## How to consume artifacts

- Direct download: https://github.com/8h28xf8szk-bit/username.artifacts/raw/main/artifacts/<date>/artifact-<timestamp>.zip
- Git clone: git clone https://github.com/8h28xf8szk-bit/username.artifacts.git
- Releases (if used): https://github.com/8h28xf8szk-bit/username.artifacts/releases

## Verification & provenance

- To verify authenticity you can include checksums alongside artifacts (e.g., sha256sum files) and sign releases if desired.
