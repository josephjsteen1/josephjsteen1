Sometimes files cannot be automatically 
merged because your local changes conflict
with the changes from the commits merged.

Use the Resolve tool to make this easier.
You can handle several files at once just
dragging in the parts of the file you want
to keep and dragging out to discard.
Use all chunks from HEAD or temp by tapping next to the filename.
