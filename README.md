# Hi, I’m Joseph – aka “JBird” 🐦

## 🛠️ About Me

- 🏗️ **From Construction to Code**  
  My background is in commercial and residential construction, with some marine electrical work thrown in for good measure!
- 👨‍🎨 **Artist & Creator**  
  I love art and drawing—my profile pic was generated by Copilot and turned into an iSticker!
- 📱 **iPhone SE Dev**  
  I learn and code right from my iPhone SE. It’s wild, sometimes frustrating, but always rewarding.
- 🧠 **Challenge Seeker**  
  I jump into new topics headfirst—especially when I know nothing about them.
- 🌱 **Always Growing**  
  I’ve learned a ton over the last few years and can’t wait to keep going.
